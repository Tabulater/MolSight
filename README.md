# Molsight

A 3D molecular viewer I'm building to make protein visualization easier and more intuitive. No more clunky desktop apps - just open it in your browser and start exploring structures.

## What's Working
- Load any structure from the PDB database (just type the ID)
- Or drag & drop your own PDB files
- Switch between different visualization styles (ribbons, spheres, etc.)
- Spin, zoom, and pan around the 3D view

## Quick Start
1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed
2. Clone and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/molsight.git
cd molsight
npm install
npm run dev
```
3. Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser

## Tech Under the Hood
- Frontend: TypeScript + React
- Styling: Tailwind (keeps things clean)
- 3D Magic: Custom WebGL for smooth rendering
- Build: Vite (super fast dev server)

## Wanna Help?
Found a bug? Have an idea? Open an issue or send a PR! I'm always looking to improve this.
